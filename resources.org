    - Great for polyglot programmers
    - Excellent for quick referencing

*** [[https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/][Lua 5.4 Reference Manual]]
    - Official language documentation
    - Precise and thorough
    - Use like a dictionary (not a tutorial)

** 🧑‍💻 Interactive & Project-Based Learning
*** [[https://exercism.org/tracks/lua][Exercism – Lua Track]]
    - Interactive programming challenges
    - Mentor feedback available
    - Ideal for learning through practice

*** [[https://github.com/EmmanuelOga/luakoans][Lua Koans]]

    - Cleanly structured and modern
    - Great second step after PIL

*** [[https://github.com/LewisJEllis/awesome-lua][Awesome Lua (GitHub)]]
    - Curated list of libraries, tools, and articles
    - Great for expanding your Lua toolkit

** ⚙️ For System Scripting, FFI, or Neovim
*** [[https://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html][LuaJIT FFITutorial]]
    - Low-level interfacing with C
    - For embedded and performance-critical Lua

*** [[https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide][Neovim Lua Guide]]
    - For configuring and scripting Neovim in Lua
    - Best resource for plugin authors or power users

** 🏁 Suggested Learning Path
   1. Read *Programming in Lua* fully.
   2. Practice with *Exercism* and *Lua Koans*.
   3. Keep *Lua Manual* and *Awesome Lua* as reference.
   4. Build scripts, Neovim configs, or small Lua apps.
   5. Deepen your skills with *Lua for Professionals*.

** 🔥 Pro Tip
   Lua is small but powerful — you can master it quickly by writing real code regularly.

* Sources
  - Read the dotfiles of Librephoenix (he's got a way to blur qutebrowser)

* To master Nix, you might need a little idea (or maybe huge) about Functional Programming
  1. _/Start Here:/_ [[https://learnyouahaskell.github.io/chapters.html][Learn You a Haskell - read and code along]]
  2. _/Practice Here:/_ [[https://exercism.org/][Exercism]]

* Master Nix
  I just made a list of learning resources that I used to understand NixOS, so perfect timing!
